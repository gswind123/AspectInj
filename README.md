AspectInj
=========
This is a solution for Java AOP
The basic idea is to add static <before> <after> methods in each target method body.(Code Injuection)
The injections are done at JSR269 process, only support Javac compilation environment for now,which means it doesn't work on Eclipse.
Run the demo to see how it works.
